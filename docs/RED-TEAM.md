Look for any methodological issues.

If any are identified, resolve them.

Once resolved, rerun the analysis and modify the local and root-level FINDINGS.md file if the findings have meaningfully changed.

Post results in a new RED-TEAM-REPORTS/ directory, timestamped, with information on the methodological issue, how it was resolved, and how that impacted the findings.
