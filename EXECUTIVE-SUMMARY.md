Analysis 22: Prioritizing improvements OTP in routes with high ridership, even if they have higher-than-average OTP, would improve the experience for users, more than improving OTP for lower-ridership users. 

Analysis 23: Some garages, like Collier's, appear to have better OTP than others for reasons not captured in the existing data. 

Analysis 24: Drop in ridership is primarily due to remote and hybrid work.

25: Q1 (worst) bust routes have lowest OTP and highest ridership share -- targeting these would lead to the highest-impact intervention. 

## Data Needed
Need stop-level boarding data to get a stronger sense of whether certain stops are rarely used (and, if they are within 200m of another stop, could easily be consolidated with limited negative impact on ridership)

## Possible Interventions

Add limited-stop overlays instead of removing stops; this would improve OTP.

Invest in weekday reliability improvements -- weekend ridership is recovering normally. 

Target eastern corridor.
