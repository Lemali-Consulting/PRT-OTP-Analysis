Is the Bus Stop lookup table also something we should include for material information?

https://truetime.portauthority.org/gtfsrt-bus/
- These are so-called "TrueTime" feeds, including Vehicle position, Trip Update, and Alert. Might be useful to be able to scrape and track these over time 🤔

Perhaps I should ask for comments describing every query run?

## Sarah Notes

Ok I have thoughts on this and please also share your interpretations. 

2) I feel like the road layout/route has got to be relevant to this.  For example 5th Ave has been under construction for a while. Penn Ave always has tge worst traffic. Rte 28 sucks. Etc., etc. Whereas some routes might be on backroads less likely to get backed up. Or not go over bridges. You get what I mean. I wonder if type of road can be captured somehow??
